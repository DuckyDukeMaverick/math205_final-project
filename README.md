# The Friendship Paradoxes

The Friendship Paradoxes is a family of classical results in classical results at the intersection of graph theory and sociology. Here I investigates two most poopular version of the Friendship Paradox. The first is due to Feld, whose paper in 1998 empirically offered a mathematical explanation for the fact that, on average, the number of friends of friends is smaller than than on individuals. The second is due allegedly to Hofstad, who proved that the expected number of friends of an individual is smaller than that of his/her friend.

I supply probabilistic argument for both results, based on of Hofstad's book "Random Graphs and Complex Networks". Details can be found in the report. I also verify these phenomena on empirical data, sourced from [Rozemberczki & Sarkar (2020)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07959):
